# Middlemanager

Middlemanager is a website to create a more secure trading environment for users of www.reddit.com/r/garlicmarket who wish to use a community member as a middleman .

Middlemanager allows for trade creation and user invitation so that only the necessary people gain access to the trade's details.

A middleman can be invited through the site. Analytics are kept on each registered middleman where a rating is assigned based on how many trades they have successfully completed. Their fee (if any) is also shown.

At each step of the trade, users will simply push a button once they have sent/received something to/from the middleman. Timestamps are kept for every event to log the entire trade process. GRLC transation hashes, shipping/tracking info, etc. can be saved as a note for each trade step as well. As a recipient of the trade, you should never be questioning where your goods are.

Middlemanager is in active development with a simple mobile-friendly UI in bootstrap and quickly prototyped code with Django 2.0. Heavy refactoring will be done if the initial project is completed and there is a genuine community interest in the website.
